Functions for plotting interactive d3 visualizations from within a Jupyter notebook.
Based in Javascript, these plots do not depend on the interactive widgets offered in a
typically executed notebook, so they are compatible with Appyters, or web applications produced
from notebooks (see https://github.com/maayanLab/appyter/)
